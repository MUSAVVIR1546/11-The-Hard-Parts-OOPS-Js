When building applications, especially larger ones, creating objects dynamically and efficiently is key. One approach to achieve this is by using a factory function that helps us add properties like `name`, `score`, and methods, such as the `increment` function, to objects in a streamlined way.

In this example, we declare a function `userCreator`. This function can't execute until we call it. When we call this function, it creates a local execution context, which has parameters like `name` and `score` as the memory for the new user.

This function dynamically assigns the `name`, `score`, and `increment` method, and then returns the object.

In this approach, we can see that each object has its own method called `increment`, which is inefficient for memory usage. This is good for small applications but inefficient for larger ones, (with 100+ functions, login, and logout)features.

The solution to this issue is to share a location that contains the method, so when an object is used, it can refer to the shared methods. This leads to a prototype-based solution that resolves memory inefficiencies.

**Example**
```javascript
function userCreator(name, score) {
    const newUser = {};  // Create a new empty object
    newUser.name = name;  // Assign the provided name to the new user
    newUser.score = score;  // Assign the provided score to the new user
    newUser.increment = function() {  // Define a method to increment score
        this.score++;  // Increase the user's score by 1
    };
    return newUser;  // Return the newly created user object
}

const user1 = userCreator("Phil", 4);  // Create a user with name 'Phil' and score 4
const user2 = userCreator("Julia", 5);  // Create a user with name 'Julia' and score 5
console.log(user1.increment());  // Increment `user1`'s score, making it 5

```
