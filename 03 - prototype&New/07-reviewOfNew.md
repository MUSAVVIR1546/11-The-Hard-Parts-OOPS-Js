## "Understanding the Role of `new` Keyword in Object Creation and Prototypes."

In modern JavaScript development, understanding how objects and prototypes work is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. The `new` keyword plays a key role in simplifying this process and ensuring proper functionality.

The `new` keyword simplifies the process of creating objects and making bonds with the prototype. If we don't use the `new` keyword, then the `this` keyword links to the global object, which gives us wrong behavior and bugs. To avoid this problem, developers capitalize the constructor function name to remind others of the need to use the `new` keyword.

#### Main Points:

- If we don't use the `new` keyword, then the `this` keyword links to the global object.
- Storing shared functions in the prototype is an efficient way, as all objects use one function.
- The `new` keyword automates the work of making objects and prototypes.
- Classes simplify object creation and prototype management.

**Example**
```Javascript
function UserCreator(name, score) {
    this.name = name;  // 'this' refers to the new object created by 'new'
    this.score = score;
}

UserCreator.prototype.increment = function () {
    this.score++;
};

UserCreator.prototype.login = function () {
    console.log("login");
};

const user1 = new UserCreator('John', 5);
user1.increment(); // Prototype is used, no duplication of increment function
console.log(user1); // { name: 'John', score: 6 }
```
